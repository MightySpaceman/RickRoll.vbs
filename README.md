# RickRoll.vbs V1.0
Expanded version of my [RickRoll.py](https://github.com/MightySpaceman/RickRoll.py) project - adapted to VBS to run without opening a command window.

# What It Does
- Download rick.jpeg to c:\tmp (without opening command prompt)
- Set rick.jpeg as desktop background
- Open Never Gonna Give You Up in default web browser

### Rickroll.vbs only works on windows
It's a VBS file, duh
